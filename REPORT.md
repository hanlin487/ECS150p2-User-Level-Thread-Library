## Queue 
### Implementation
#### Queue Data Structure Design
The queue implementation is pretty simple with all the functions defined in  
the header. The actual queue structure is pretty simple as it's just a  
linked list with `node` objects that contain a `void *` data pointer and a  
`node *` pointer to the next node. As for the `queue` itself it has a head and 
a tail.
